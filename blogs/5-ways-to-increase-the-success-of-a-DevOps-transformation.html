						DevOps focuses on improving organisations ability to consistently and efficiently increase customer value through the optimisation of their IT delivery capabilities. To achieve this DevOps requires significant changes to an organisationsâ€™ culture, processes and tooling in order to increase collaboration, teamwork, innovation, automation and unity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Organisations which have successfully undertaken a DevOps transformation have been able to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/" target="_blank">increase code quality, improve security, reduce test duration and time spent firefighting</a>. Yet, despite the potential benefits that DevOps can provide, DevOps transformations have a high failure rate and even those that don't fail have a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-secret-to-devops-success/" target="_blank">75% chance of failing to meet expectations</a>. The below best practices can be used to increase the success of a DevOps transformation and reduce the risk of outcomes not meeting expectations.

					<h3><strong>1. Identify business value</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Without a clear and strategic vision driving a DevOps transformation it has a risk of failing before it even begins. Reasons for embarking on the transformation such as; competitors are doing it, to reduce cost, and to increase release frequency are all short term focused, lacking direction and encourage unsustainable quick fixes which do not benefit the wider organisation in the long term. 
					</p>

					<div class="pages-content-gif">
						<img src="../gif/temporary-fix.gif">
					</div>

					<p>
						Organisations should identify the strategic importance of their DevOps transformation and what business value they want to achieve from it. For example, the business and strategic value of increased release frequency could be that it promotes innovation and adaptability, creating a better online capability which improves customer satisfaction when ordering online. This aligns to the organisations' strategic goal of transitioning sales from in-store to online whilst increasing customer retention and loyalty. Additionally, this links IT with other organisational departments such as marketing and sales, helping increase organisational unity and also enabling DevOps transformation expectations to be based against business valued targets, such as increased online sales, customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. Consequentially, a strategic vision such as this for a DevOps transformation promotes a long term mindset which favours sustainable improvements rather than quick fixes, benefiting the wider organisation.

					<h3><strong>2. Understand processes, create appropriate baselines</strong></h3>
					<p>
						When starting any transformation, big or small, it is important to understand where you are starting from to prove whether the transformation has been successful. For example, if you want to improve your running capability you would typically start by understanding how far you can initially run in a set amount of time and use that as a baseline to judge if you are improving through your transformation efforts. IT operations are complicated, involving a wide range of processes and teams yet any transformation to these processes should follow the same logic. Baselines should be established at the beginning of the journey to effectively validate the success of the transformation.
					</p>
					<p>
						A comprehensive understanding of existing processes ensures appropriate baselines can be created and that transformation efforts can start on areas where improvements are needed. Without a thorough understanding of end-to-end processes it can be easy to focus initial transformation efforts on areas which are typically more time consuming due to having a large amount of responsibilities such as Development or Testing. This can have limited benefit if there are other external issues causing constraints which are not fully understood. For example, Testing can take <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/sw_testing/" target="_blank">up to 50% of development time</a> so can appear as a logical place to begin a transformation. However, there may be other underlying issues outside of Testings' control which constrain performance such as; low code quality resulting in high numbers of code defects which takes time for developers to fix, or inconsistent environments requiring tests to be repeated after an environment is fixed. In these cases, focusing a transformation on testing alone might add little to no benefit compared to transforming development or environment processes.

					<h3><strong>3. Define DevOps for your organisation</strong></h3>
					<p>
						It is predicted that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/make-culture-a-priority-for-an-agile-organization/" target="_blank"> 90% of organisations aiming to leverage DevOps without addressing the cultural foundations will fail</a>. This coupled with how <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-science-of-devops-decoded/" target="_blank">the largest challenges organisations face when expanding their DevOps transformation are people related</a>  it is crucial that the reasons for undertaking a DevOps transformation and its intended implementation are understood across all levels of an organisation. This will set expectations, reduce confusion, encourage desired behavioural and cultural changes, and increase active participation from bottom-up and top-down.
					</p>

					<div class="pages-content-gif">
						<img src="../gif/new-challenge.gif">
					</div>

	
					<p>
						As DevOps promotes adaptability through quick feedback loops this too should be applied to the strategic vision and the intended implementation of a DevOps transformation, with any updates being clearly communicated to the rest of the organisation to ensure alignment and that active participation continues to support its success. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="pages-content pages-content-one">	
					<h3><strong>4. Start small and build incrementally</strong></h3>
					<p>
						A DevOps transformation requires substantial changes to almost all elements of IT operations, it is a complex process which requires careful planning and management. Therefore, Trying to implement these changes quickly can increase the risk of failure. Starting small and building incrementally provides better control and enables momentum to be built which can increase chances of success. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Starting small can mean localising a DevOps transformation to a specific team, application, or both. Starting small and localised enables issues to be quickly resolved and the implementation can be adapted to improve its success when scaled. It is recommended that an initial team contains highly skilled individuals, with an equal mix of technical and personal skills. As DevOps requires collaboration within and across teams personal skills are just as important as technical skills for a transformation to be successful. When choosing an initial application to uplift it can be beneficial to focus on one which has low traffic and few dependencies with other applications, as this enables the application transformation to be localised and minimises its impact if there are any challenges.

					<h3><strong>5. Monitor & Governance</strong></h3>

					<p>
						In traditional IT delivery monitoring and governance are sources of inefficiency and constraint as they are commonly time-consuming and require substantial manual effort. Despite this, effective DevOps transformation relies on increased governance and monitoring throughout the IT delivery process to ensure that work is completed to a high standard and any issues are quickly identified and resolved to prevent further inefficiencies down the line.
					</p>
					<p>
						 The availability of new tooling and capabilities enables the automation of governance and monitoring, removing manual effort and only causing constraints when issues are identified. In doing so, monitoring and governance work hand-in-hand to drive greater customer value through improving delivery efficiency and capability.
