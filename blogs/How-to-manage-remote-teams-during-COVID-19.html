				In an attempt to reduce the devastating impact of COVID-19 the UK went into lockdown on 23rd March 2020. This caught most businesses off guard making them have to quickly decide: if they continue operating do they make all employees work from home temporarily until it is safe for them all to return to their offices or risk the welfare of their employees by making them continue to travel to work? Most companies chose the former making working from home mandatory until it was safe to return to work. This has dramatically affected how, why and when employees work. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The timelines on when it will be safe for all employees to return to work are still unknown however it is likely to be when a vaccine is widely available which is currently predicted to take a further  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one" target="_blank">12-18 months</a>. If these predictions are correct, then the decision for all employees to work from home as a temporary fix might in fact become the new normal. This therefore may result in new challenges which require organisations, managers and teams needing to adapt and innovate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This blog will explore how managers can adopt new practices to increase employee motivation and productivity whilst managing teams working remotely during COVID-19. Additionally, this blog will review how adopting appropriate managerial actions can in fact result in a unique opportunity to make long term changes to organisational culture which will encourage creativity, innovation and collaboration. In doing so, this blog aims to provide a <i> Platform of Understanding </i> on the importance of successful remote management during COVID-19 and how employee motivation and productivity can be sustained during and beyond COVID-19 through the simultaneous creation of a DevOps culture.
			</p>

				<h4><strong>Side note: DevOps?</strong></h4>
				<p>	
					This blog contains information that is applicable for all organisations, managers and teams that have seen an increase in working from home during COVID-19. DevOps is an approach to work which is rising in popularity predominantly within the IT industry as it focuses on improving IT operational efficiency, delivery speed and quality by improving processes and tooling, furthering automation and creating a culture of collaboration, communication, shared responsibility and feedback. There are small elements of this blog that are tailored towards those working in IT organisations seeking to improve their DevOps capability. However, the core premise of DevOps can be widely applied across industries as this blog will try to explain. However, If you are interested in finding out more on DevOps and its related areas, DevOps Platform blogs can be found <a href="../blog" target="_blank"> here</a>.

			<h3><strong>Unexpected challenges to teams working from home</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Working remotely has been a growing demand from employees in recent years as it provides them with a range of benefits such as; increased flexibility, more time with family, and a reduction in both the cost and duration of travel. Consequentially, <a href="https://open.buffer.com/state-remote-work-2018/#benefits" target="_blank">90% of those that have been working remotely full time intend to continue doing so for the rest of their careers </a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, organisations typically do not have suitable working methods, training, and tooling to support remote workers which is why remote workers are <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/causes-of-stress-in-remote-workplaces-and-how-to-deal-with-them/" target="_blank">15% more likely to experience high levels of stress compared to those who work at the office. </a> 
			</p>
				<div class="pages-content-gif">
						<img src="../gif/work-stress.gif">
				</div>

			<p>
				If managers do not understand the challenges faced by remote workers and how they can help to overcome them it can result in significant unexpected consequences on employee wellbeing, such as; depression, anxiety and decreased motivation. Outlined below are the key issues experienced by remote workers and how they occur:
			</p>

			<h4><strong>Loneliness</strong></h4>

			<p>
				Working in an office full-time results in employees spending almost <a href="https://www.dpgplc.co.uk/working-life/" target="_blank">50% of their day (not including time asleep) at work</a> where they are surrounded by colleagues to interact with. Working from home without adequate communication tools removes this social interaction which can quickly cause demotivation due to feelings of isolation and disconnection. Consequentially, <a href="https://open.buffer.com/state-remote-work-2018/#benefits" target="_blank"> loneliness is ranked as the biggest struggle for employees who work remotely.</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				To overcome this remote workers change their working space between café’s, home and coworking spaces. However, if this ability is removed, as it currently has been, it can be the <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-keep-your-team-motivated-remotely" target="_blank"> the biggest source of demotivation.</a>
			</p>

			<h4><strong>Burnout</strong></h4>

			<p>
				Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It’s knock on effects can include depression, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and becoming emotionally drained. All of these factors will directly impact the performance of an employee negatively and be difficult to resolve quickly. Burnout can occur in remote workers due a range of reasons which include:
			</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li>
					<strong>Inability to switch off -</strong> Working from home removes the ability to easily disassociate work from home as there is no substantial physical difference. This can make it harder for employees who work at home to mentally switch off, quickly eroding their work-life balance causing significant emotional stress
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Proving productivity -</strong> The ability to work from home can be perceived as a benefit provided by an employer. To show appreciation for this it is normal for employees to respond to this by increasing their performance. However, when working remotely it is difficult for employees to adequately display this increased effort or to feel it has been acknowledged due to the lack of visibility and communication with team members and managers. This can result in them feeling burdened with having to continuously exert additional effort over and above their duties in order to overcome this challenge. Consequentially, employees can get caught in a vicious cycle of trying to work even harder and longer to prove themselves whilst not getting the recognition for this additional effort. This can be detrimental when these stresses are experienced over sustained periods of time
				</li>
				<div class="pages-content-gif">
						<img src="../gif/over-worked.gif">
				</div>

				<li>
					<strong>Management setting unrealistic targets -</strong> Ineffective communication tooling and processes can detrimentally impact remote workers ability to effectively discuss with their managers what they are working on and their progress. This can result in managers misunderstanding their capacity and setting unrealistic tasks or deadlines. This can cause significant stress when coupled with the stress of proving productivity, as mentioned above, as employees will feel obliged to work harder and longer to meet the unrealistic deadlines. This then also feeds into the ever-reducing work life balance
				</li>
				<div class="pages-content-gif">
					<img src="../gif/email-overload.gif">
				</div>
			</ul>
			
			<h4><strong>COVID-19</strong></h4>
			<p>
				The points outlined above have been issues that have been faced by remote workers for a number of years. However, the economic, emotional and phycological stresses of COVID-19 can add some further issues. Whilst working remotely has become more commonplace in some industries and roles for some time, for a large number of employees who now find themselves working from home this will be a completely new concept that was not available to them previously. This can be a cause of stress particularly if they do not have the facilities and space at home to set themselves up to work. Other factors also come into play such as general anxiety regarding what is going on in the world which can distract from daily duties as well as other responsibilities at home that cannot be avoided such as childcare
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="foundation" class="pages-content pages-content-one offset">	

			<h3><strong>Creating a foundation to work from home</strong></h3>

			<p>
				Below details different attitudes and processes managers should encourage their team(s) to adopt if they are not used to working from home.
			</p>	

			<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li>
					<strong>As a team discuss and agree on expected working hours and routines.</strong>Although regular 9-5 hours don't necessarily need to be abided to, it can be detrimental if working hours do not align
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Encourage video conferencing but acknowledged that it is not always possible.</strong> Video conferencing offers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-zoom/2017/10/30/5-reasons-why-your-company-needs-to-embrace-video-conferencing-now/#431c2ccf47c4" target="_blank">improved communication and increased engagement compared to phone calls.</a> It also improves a managers’ ability to identify early signs of burnout, which is common with remote workers. However, video conferencing might not be possible for a variety of reasons, especially if employees are working at home with their partners and/or children
				</li>
				<div class="pages-content-gif">
						<img src="../gif/working-from-home.gif">
				</div>
				<li>
					<strong>Advocate taking regular breaks.</strong> When working in an office there are regular breaks from work, such as walking to a colleagues desk, going for a coffee, or attending a meeting. Managers should encourage regular breaks from work to reduce the risk of burnout and should not be expected their team(s) to be productive and contactable for every minute of their working day
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Encourage a fixed workplace.</strong> Although it might not always be possible due to living arrangements it can be psychologically beneficial to have an allocated space for work in order to help segregate work from personal life and will in turn help employees to stick to a routine
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Ensure there is no expectation to be productive outside of working hours.</strong> Teams should not be encouraged to reply to emails or finish work, no matter how small it might be, outside of working hours. This can quickly erode work-life balance and increase the chances of burnout significantly reducing performance in the long term
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Start the day with a plan.</strong> Planning what is intended to be completed in a working day provides clarity and direction. There still should be flexibility in accommodating unplanned priority tasks. However, in doing so plans will provide clarity on the impact of accepting unplanned work on the planned work, so it can be communicated easily if necessary
				</li>
				
				
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="motivation" class="pages-content pages-content-one offset">	

			<h3><strong>How to increase remote workers motivation</strong></h3>

			<p>	
				Motivation is what drives an individual to accomplish personal and organisational goals. There are a wide range of motivational factors including: salary, security, interesting work, community, collaboration, purpose, working conditions, growth opportunities, feedback, appreciation. Recent studies have identified that some of the most important motivational factors are: <a href="https://www.joe.org/joe/1998june/rb3.php/nR:/journal-current-issue.php" target="_blank"> salary, job security, </a><a href="https://hbr.org/2008/07/employee-motivation-a-powerful-new-model" target="_blank"> interesting work and community.</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				Managers need to understand the different motivational factors and how they are valued by their team(s). A managers ability to design and manage their team(s) work in accordance to their valued motivation factors is as important to employees as their most valued motivational factor.
			</p>

			<div class="pages-content-gif">
					<img src="../gif/good-manager.gif">
			</div>

			<p>
				It is unsurprising that the emotional and economic pressures of COVID-19 will have a significant impact on the importance of each motivational factor. With <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/workforce-confidence-index-new-fortnightly-pulse-mood-emily-spaven/?trk=featured_directory" target="_blank"> rapid increase in job searches and concerns over personal finances</a> it is fair to assume job security and salary will currently be the most important factors for most employees. However, during COVID-19 salary and job security are likely to be dictated by governmental, organisational and economic factors. Managers need to be aware of these motivation factors importance and stresses but will typically be extremely limited on altering them and managing their effect on their team(s). Consequentially, this blog will focus on the other important motivational factors which managers can have significant control over; community and interesting work.
			</p>

			<h4><strong>Community</strong></h4>
			<p>
				<h5>Why is it important?</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				The sense of belonging and social connection that comes with being part of a community is important both in and outside of work as it increases collaboration, trust and creativity. 
			</p>

			<p>
				If managers are able to successfully foster a sense of community it will help reduce or remove their teams sense of isolation and loneliness, which are the largest struggles for remote workers. Additionally, increasing a managers bond with their team(s) will provide them with a greater understanding of their team(s) values and priorities. 
			</p>

			<div class="pages-content-gif">
					<img src="../gif/communication.gif">
			</div>

			<p>
				As sources of motivation differs between individuals, the greater understanding a manager has on each member of their team(s) will improve their ability to design work which encompasses their team(s) most valued motivational factors and improve overall team performance.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As employees overall motivation can be greatly impacted by their managers ability understand what motivates them and act accordingly building a sense of community can result in a range of benefits which, directly and indirectly, improve an team(s) motivation.
			</p>

			<h5>How to create a Community?</h5>

			<p>
				There are a wide range of approaches to create a community, below details those which might be more appropriate during COVID19. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The economic, emotional and psychological stresses of COVID-19 can affect individuals differently. To understand the impact these stresses are having on their team(s) managers should have daily individual catchups where they discuss a range of topics not just work related. This enables managers to gain an insight into an employees individual circumstances, issues they may be facing, an understanding of their work progress and whether an individuals work needs to be redesigned to compensate for their potential stresses.   
			</p>
			<p>
				Managers need to ensure their team(s) understand the value of their combined and individual work, why they are doing it, ensuring they are aligned, and facilitating opportunities to openly communicate with one another. This can be done by holding weekly team meetings where each team member is tasked with <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/how-company-culture-shapes-employee-motivation" target="_blank"> answering the below questions:</a>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
						<li>What did they learn this week?</li>
						<li>What impact did they have this week?</li>
						<li>What do they want to learn next week?</li>
					</ul>
			</p>

			<h4><strong>Make work interesting</strong></h4>

			<p>
				The best way for managers to increase their team’s engagement with their work is to make the work engaging. This can be achieved through job enrichment (making the work more interesting), and job enlargement (adding more responsibility). 
			</p>

			<p>
				During times of crisis, such as COVID-19, it can be common for managers to focus their teams on ensuring the quantitative / tactical work is complete, such as following the preset project plan, hitting set targets or answering the required amount of tickets. Although rules and boundaries can increase focus, too many can in fact reduce creativity and encourage teams to focus solely on achieving just the bare minimum.
			</p>

			<p>
				Managers should ensure their team(s) have capacity during this time to focus on areas of adaptive performance, creativity, problem-solving and experimentation. In doing so, it will increase their job enrichment and enable them to be better equipped and motivated to meeting the bigger / newer challenges that have arisen from the crisis, such as handling increased demand.
			</p>

			<div class="pages-content-gif">
					<img src="../gif/new-challenge.gif">
			</div>


			<p>
				The most powerful way to increase work interest and value is to solve the problems that really matter. Managers need to use the regular forms of individual and group communications they have with their team(s), as mentioned above, to identify what is important together, such as; what’s broken, what will increase growth, how critical/valuable/interesting are these problems? Once suitable problems are identified managers should enable their team(s) to take ownership, as <a href="https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=neje" target="_blank"> work ownership increases innovation and motivation.</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				Managers should also encourage their team(s) to work on problems that have an impact across teams and to collaborate with the impacted teams on creating and implementing a solution. In doing, it will increase collaboration, communication, innovation and community within and outside of a managers team(s).
			</p>


		</div>


		<div id="culture" class="pages-content pages-content-end offset">	

			<h3><strong>How managers can shape their organisations culture</strong></h3>

			<p>
				Organisational culture is the combination of deeply rooted implicit and explicit values, beliefs, behaviors and attitudes that are shared by all employees which generate a shared perception on the <a href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3431155/mod_resource/content/1/MARTINS%20%20TERBLANCHE-Build%20Org%20Cult%20for%20creat%20and%20innov%20.pdf"target="_blank">correct way things are done and understood.</a> Consequentially, as organisational cultures are shared by all employees and impact their direct and indirect thoughts and actions it can be extremely difficult to change under normal circumstances and is something that can take years to achieve.  
			</p>
			
			<h4><strong>What is DevOps Culture?</strong></h4>

			<p>
				DevOps is about improving IT operational efficiency, delivery speed and quality by improving processes and tooling, furthering automation and creating a culture of collaboration, communication, shared responsibility and feedback.  As mentioned above DevOps is an approach to IT software delivery however the benefits of adopting a DevOps culture are not limited to the IT industry by any means.  By achieving a DevOps culture any organisation can improve their ability to adapt and thrive in changing situations. 
			</p>

			<p>
				A DevOps culture focuses on open communication, incentive and responsibility alignment, respect and trust to remove barriers between teams,<a href="http://www.rcolomo.com/papers/327.pdf" target="_blank"> increase innovation, creativity and collaboration.</a> Culture can be extremely difficult to change so organisations that aim to increase their DevOps capabilities primarily focus solely on tooling and automation instead of culture. Yet, organisations which achieve a DevOps culture are able to achieve greater operational benefits.
			</p>

			<h4><strong>Managers ability to shape organisational culture during COVID-19?</strong></h4>


			<p>
				The substantial impact of COVID-19 on organisations and their working practices have made their culture more susceptible to changes and accepting new values, behaviours and attitudes.
			</p>

			<p>
				If managers adapt their approach to managing their teams to minimise the impact of burnout and loneliness through creating a sense of community, understanding their team(s) motivational factors and designing work accordingly, and increasing work ownership and enrichment they will begin to embed the key characteristics of a DevOps culture simultaneously; collaboration, communication, shared responsibility and feedback.
			</p>

			<p>
				In doing so, managers will be able to increase their teams motivation and productivity whilst also increasing the organisational capabilities to meet the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond by creating an organisational <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/how-company-culture-shapes-employee-motivation" target="_blank"> culture which fosters innovation and creativity.</a>
