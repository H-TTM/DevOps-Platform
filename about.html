			<p>
				Hi, my name is Duncan Moreland, I am a Management Consultant working for a global IT & Consulting company. I have created DevOps Platform to provide a relatable and useful understanding of DevOps; a new approach to software delivery for organisations across the World. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My career experience includes managing numerous large software deliveries. These have enabled me to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the software delivery process including highly technical methods, principles and approaches to delivery as well as their limitations. I have seen firsthand the benefits that DevOps can bring and have undertaken roles that have enabled me to play a key role in the development of DevOps within my organisation and other organisations through my Consultant role.
			</p>
			<p>
				DevOps is a personal interest of mine, it's a rising movement in IT which has the potential to change how all organisations operate significantly. Yet, trying to understand DevOps (and anything related to IT) can sometimes be extremely difficult. In my experience this can be because most IT related Blogs and websites use large amounts of technical jargon that make it almost impossible to understand without multiple degrees and/or significant experience working directly in the IT industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				The aim of DevOps Platform is to use my personal experience and other related online sources to create Blogs on DevOps which are informative and understandable for anyone that has an interest in DevOps and its capabilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have any questions feel free reach out to me on <a class="about-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-moreland/">LinkedIn here</a>.
			</p>
		
			<br>
			<p><i>
				Another passion of mine is not getting sued, so it is important to highlight that I am not providing business advice in these Blogs and all of the content is my own opinion based on my experiences and research.
				</i>
			</p>
